Conducted analysis of an ecommerce platform Virnda stores using the dataset provided by Rishab Mishra(http://linkedin.com/in/rishabhnmishra/?originalSubdomain=in) 

Steps I followed:
🔷 Data Cleaning: Checked for null values, spelling mistakes in the dataset

🔷 Data Processing: Created an age group consisting of teenager, adult,
 senior from age column and extracted month from 
 date column.

🔷 Data Analysis: Created pivot tables which presented specific data in a 
 tabular format making it easy to insert visualizations.

🔷 Data Visualizations: Added clustered columns, bar charts, pie charts and
 slicers which made it easy to draw insights from.
 

Key Insights:

 Tamil Nadu.
 
📅Most amount of sales and orders recorded in the month of March.

🛒Amazon and Flipkart contributed to most amount of sales.

🥻Set, Western wear and top were among the most purchased items.

👩‍💼Women of the Adult age group are more likely to buy.

Suggestions based on the data:

1)Coduct marketing campaings targeted to women of ages 22-31 showcasing the most purchased items like the top and western wear.

2)Have sales on all your on all your ecommerce sites but if you need to cost cut and have a few sales then prioritize having them on Amazon and Filpkart.
